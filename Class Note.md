# Class Note

## Week 1

$\bar \lambda$ can be calculated from the mean. Say 0.5.\
Then we calculated a new $\lambda$. \
If $\lambda > \bar \lambda$ then we can do the project.

We can assume that $\lambda$ is $[0.01, 0.5]$. 
Then I'd be able to know the prior rate, how the data generate, and the simulation.

Page 5. Each dot is 100 samples.
For $\bar \lambda = 0.05$, we expect 1 to 12 (approx.) people to say yes.

Page 8. Of all the data equals 20, what's the probability?

Page 12. When new information comes in, is it real random?

Page 15. Fixed $\theta$, we can generate data from model.
$p(\theta)$ is prior distribution.
