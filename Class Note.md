# Class Note

## Week 1

Goal: Hi - and welcome to Bayesian Learning and Business Analytics! In this first week of class we will gove over an introduction to Bayesian thinking and to the course in general. 
We will also get starting with understanding the foundations of Bayesian learning. 
All materials can be accessed via this Rstudio project file: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rju3cvolxcuhqrb/AABLF9t9o9XDUl-ecYS3rtcRa?dl=1

Reading: Readings for Week 1: Chapters 1 and 2. I have also included two articles in the associated module folder 
    - one on Bayesian A/B testing and another general article about Bayesian thinking and Artificial Intelligence. 

$\bar \lambda$ can be calculated from the mean. Say 0.5.\
Then we calculated a new $\lambda$. \
If $\lambda > \bar \lambda$ then we can do the project.

We can assume that $\lambda$ is $[0.01, 0.5]$. 
Then I'd be able to know the prior rate, how the data generate, and the simulation.

Page 5. Each dot is 100 samples.
For $\bar \lambda = 0.05$, we expect 1 to 12 (approx.) people to say yes.

Page 8. Of all the data equals 20, what's the probability?

Page 12. When new information comes in, is it real random?

Page 15. Fixed $\theta$, we can generate data from model.
$p(\theta)$ is prior distribution.


## Week 2

Goal: This week we will start by finishing the materials from last week. 
Then we will move on to Multilevel Models and Shrinkage estimation. 
These are very important frameworks for dealing with applications where we need to estimate many parameters weights that can reasonably be thought of as "related" or "similar". 
We will look at a couple of applications of this scenario. 

Reading: The relevant materials for this week is Chapter 5 (Hierarchical Models) 
and Chapter 15 (Hieararchical Linear Models) in the Bayesian Data Analysis text book.
